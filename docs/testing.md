# Testing — Proof Lanes, Budgets, and Repair Receipts

Every change in this repo is validated through a named *proof lane* —
a deterministic recipe an agent can rerun without re-discovering it.
Lanes are declared in `.jankurai/proof-lanes.toml`; this doc indexes them,
records the budgets/kill-switches that bound the long-running ones,
and points at the structured error surface that produces machine-
readable repair receipts.

## Proof-lane index

| Lane                                 | Proves                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `setup`                              | Prime the workspace build cache before a wider proof run.                                             |
| `check`                              | Root validation gate: fast, score, security, rust-map, rust-witness, and rust-diagnose.              |
| `test`                               | Fast workspace test proof.                                                                            |
| `verify`                             | Alias for the root validation gate.                                                                   |
| `fast`                               | Workspace fmt, file-size policy, type-check, and full unit/integration test sweep. Uses `scripts/sccache_wrapper.sh`, which falls back cleanly when local `sccache` is absent. Quick iteration lane, not the pre-push gate. |
| `pr-ci`                              | Complete local engine/component/conformance/security/audit/package gates through `scripts/ci-local.sh pr-ci`; GitHub adds four native packaging targets. |
| `fast-check`                         | Workspace compile proof for the default health lane.                                                  |
| `fast-test`                          | Workspace test proof for the default health lane.                                                     |
| `hygiene`                            | Format and file-size only; cheapest pre-commit gate.                                                  |
| `clippy`                             | `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.                                              |
| `medium`                             | `fast` plus `--help` smoke for `cli` and `server`.                                                    |
| `phase8-smoke`                       | Same as `medium`; pinned for phase-8 regression triage.                                               |
| `kernel-cursor`                      | Cursor-specific kernel regression tests without the full workspace sweep.                             |
| `cache-warm`                         | Prime the workspace build cache before a wider proof run.                                             |

Lane definitions: `.jankurai/proof-lanes.toml`. To rerun a lane:

```
rtk just <lane-name>
```

(or invoke the command list from the TOML directly).

SQLite parity boundary: the official evidence flow lives in
[`docs/sqlite-parity.md`](sqlite-parity.md), and `redline-testing-official`
is the only lane that produces committed parity evidence. RedlineDB does not
expose a local SQLite parity coverage/benchmark/report/sentinel producer; the
in-tree `sqlite_parity` commands and prior parity bundle workflows fail closed.
The retired quick/medium replay, case-list, and local diff helpers are not
release lanes; performance measurements use `perf-full` or the official report
workflow through the included, hash-verified runner.
The proof-lane definitions and audit policy remain pinned in
`.jankurai/proof-lanes.toml` and `agent/audit-policy.toml`.

The official lane builds `subrepos/redline-testing` with its preserved lockfile,
stages its corpus and metadata, and binds evidence to the runner binary digest.
No separately released runner or sibling checkout is required. Run it with:

```bash
just redline-testing-official
```

Set `REDLINEDB_SQLITE_PARITY_SQLITE_BIN=/path/to/sqlite3` to run
`redline-testing-official` against a pinned SQLite shell with optional shell and
extension features enabled. If unset, the official wrapper builds the SQLite
`3.53.1` autoconf shell through `scripts/sqlite/build-reference.sh` and exports
`target/sqlite-reference/3.53.1/bin/sqlite3` before comparing cases. The
builder verifies the upstream SHA3-256 digest and smokes percentile, math,
FTS5, RTREE, DBSTAT, `generate_series`, and `uint` support.

For narrow repair loops, prefer the package-scoped lanes above over `fast` when the touched surface is already known. They stay deterministic without forcing a workspace-wide run.

The `beyond-postgres-reference` lane is self-contained locally:

```
rtk just beyond-postgres-reference
```

If `REDLINEDB_POSTGRES_URL` is set, the lane uses that database. Otherwise it
starts `${REDLINEDB_POSTGRES_IMAGE:-postgres:16-alpine}` with database
`redlinedb_beyond`, user `redlinedb`, password `postgres`, and local port
`${REDLINEDB_POSTGRES_PORT:-55432}`. The script waits for container health,
exports `REDLINEDB_POSTGRES_URL`, runs `beyond_sqlite_manifest` and
`beyond_postgres_reference`, then removes the container. Set
`REDLINEDB_POSTGRES_KEEP=1` to keep the local container for debugging.

To reproduce the PR-side jankurai failure mode before pushing, commit the
candidate changes and run:

```
rtk scripts/ci-local.sh pr-gate
```

That command fetches `origin/main`, applies the same branch-freshness check as
`.github/workflows/jankurai.yml`, then runs `ops/ci/jankurai-staged-gate.sh`
with `BASE_REF=origin/main`.

To reproduce the complete PR CI surface locally, run:

```
rtk scripts/ci-local.sh pr-ci
```

That command runs the same shared dispatchers used by `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
`CI_FAST_STAGE=preflight`, each `tests` matrix shard, `CI_PARITY_STAGE=redline-testing-official`,
and `scripts/guard-official-evidence.sh`. It stops at the first failing local
job and preserves the underlying command output.

The parity stage ends with `ops/ci/check-report.sh`, which renders the SQLite
report in official mode (`--run-provenance`) and the PostgreSQL block through
`check-postgres`, both into scratch copies. Both refuse a run whose source tree
was dirty when it started: an uncommitted or untracked change under the source
input paths (`SOURCE_INPUT_PATHS` in
`subrepos/redline-testing/src/evidence/identity.rs`) means the measured
binaries are not the commit being pushed. `pr-ci`, and so the pre-push hook,
therefore need a clean checkout; commit, stash or move work in progress first.
Generated outputs (README, `benchmark-results/`, `assets/`) and ignored build
output do not count.

To run local mirrors for the broader PR workflow set, including dependency
review, branch freshness, staged jankurai gate, and the input-boundary FFI
cross-check, run:

```
rtk scripts/ci-local.sh all
```

## Publication and review

`main` on `neverhuman/redline` (repository id `1390165945`, named in
`ops/release/authority.env`) must carry this protection, which an admin
applies with `bash ops/release/main-protection.sh apply`:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Required status check | `RedlineDB/required`, strict: the head must be up to date with `main` |
| Approving reviews | 1, dismissed when a new commit is pushed |
| History | linear; force-push and deletion refused; enforced for admins |
| Merge method | rebase only; squash merges and merge commits are disabled |

`bash ops/release/main-protection.sh check` compares the live settings with this
table (read-only; any GitHub login that can read the protection) and lists every
difference. A repository admin applies the table with
`bash ops/release/main-protection.sh apply`. `ops/ci/tests/main-protection.sh`
tests both against a stub `gh`.

A pull request needs an eligible reviewer: a login that did not open the pull
request and did not author or commit any commit on it. Rewriting author or
committer so a login becomes eligible is not a review. A commit whose author has
no GitHub login (a bot address) is attributed to whoever produced it before any
review. The logins, credentials and host paths the maintainers use for the two
roles are operator configuration and are not kept in this repository.

1. `just pr-ci` exits 0, then one push of that head.
2. The writer opens the pull request:

```sh
gh pr create --repo neverhuman/redline --base main --head <branch> \
  --title "<subject>" --body-file <body-file>
```

3. The reviewer checks eligibility, then approves the full head SHA after the push:

```sh
gh pr view <PR> --repo neverhuman/redline --json author,headRefOid \
  --jq '{opened_by: .author.login, head: .headRefOid}'
gh api --paginate repos/neverhuman/redline/pulls/<PR>/commits \
  --jq '.[] | {sha, author: .author.login, committer: .committer.login}'
gh api --method POST repos/neverhuman/redline/pulls/<PR>/reviews \
  -f commit_id=<full sha> -f event=APPROVE -F body=@<review-file>
```

4. The writer merges after `RedlineDB/required` is success on that same SHA:

```sh
gh pr merge <PR> --repo neverhuman/redline \
  --rebase --delete-branch --match-head-commit <full sha>
```

Rebase is the one merge method: it keeps the reviewed commits as they are on a
linear `main`. The parity report bot (`.github/workflows/report-merge.yml`)
merges its report pull requests the same way.

## Budgets and kill-switches

Long-running bench lanes carry budgets and a kill-switch so an agent
can interrupt them without leaving the cluster wedged. The contract:

| Lane (class)                        | Max wall-clock | Max disk | Max syscalls (strace) |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------|------------------------|
| `phase9-smoke`                      | 5 min          | 1 GiB    | 5e7                    |
| `phase9-certification`              | 30 min         | 8 GiB    | 5e8                    |
| `phase9-xbabe1-certification`       | 60 min         | 32 GiB   | 2e9                    |
| `phase9-xbabe1-certify-with-strace` | 90 min         | 32 GiB   | 4e9 (strace overhead)  |
| `phase10-xbabe1-certification`      | 90 min         | 64 GiB   | 4e9                    |
| `phase11-oltp-gap`                  | 20 min         | 4 GiB    | 1e8                    |

These budgets are authored in `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` (added in
Section H of the repair plan); this doc is the human-readable index.

### `REDLINEDB_BENCH_KILL=1`

The bench harness honors the `REDLINEDB_BENCH_KILL` environment
variable: when set to `1` before a bench process starts, the harness
exits cleanly at the next workload boundary, flushes its in-flight
metrics, and writes a `kill_receipt.json` next to the run's output
directory. This is the supported way to abort a long bench run
without losing the partial evidence already gathered. The variable is
read once at harness startup; flipping it mid-run does not interrupt
an in-flight workload (use SIGTERM for that).

Section H of the jankurai-repair plan lands the implementation; this
doc fixes the contract so downstream tooling can rely on the variable
name today.

## Structured errors and repair receipts

Failures inside the kernel and downstream crates escalate into a
typed exception surface defined at
`crates/domain/src/error.rs::DomainError`. Every `DomainError`
carries six fields:

- `purpose` — a `module.subsystem.event` triple naming where the
  failure occurred (e.g. `kernel.storage.invalid_checksum`).
- `reason` — a one-sentence human explanation suitable for logs.
- `common_fixes` — a `&'static [&'static str]` of grep-able repair
  hints the next agent can scan without rereading the source.
- `docs_url` — the in-repo doc path that explains the dimension this
  failure belongs to (usually `docs/audit-rubric.md#<dimension>`).
- `repair_hint` — the specific proof lane to rerun.
- `source` — the underlying `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>` so the
  full causal chain stays attached.

The canonical escalation example lives at
`crates/kernel/src/error.rs::Error::into_domain` for the
`InvalidChecksum` variant. The unit tests in both crates (`cargo test
-p redlinedb-domain` and `cargo test -p redlinedb-kernel`) assert the
field shape so renames stay safe.

Authoring a new escalation:

1. Add the kernel/SQL/FFI variant to the relevant `Error` enum as
   usual.
2. Extend that crate's `into_domain` (or write one if it does not
   exist) to wrap the variant via
   `DomainError::new(...).with_source(self)`.
3. Add a unit test that asserts each of the six fields and the
   source chain.
4. Link the new failure under the relevant dimension in
   `docs/audit-rubric.md`.

A `proof-receipt.md` template lives at
`.jankurai/proof-receipt-template.md`; use it to record the lane name,
seed, raw-log path, and exit code for any non-trivial repair.

## Cost budgets and kill-switches

Every bench / certification workload is enumerated in
[`.jankurai/cost-budget.toml`](../.jankurai/cost-budget.toml) with three
hard limits — `max_wall_clock_minutes`, `max_disk_gb`,
`max_syscalls` — and a single `owner` field. The TOML is the
machine-readable source of truth; the table earlier in this file is
the human-readable summary.

The kill-switch contract: set `REDLINEDB_BENCH_KILL=1` before
launching (or `export` mid-run) and the bench harness exits at the
next workload boundary, flushes its in-flight metrics, and writes a
`kill_receipt.json` next to the run's output directory. The env var
name is fixed under `[global].kill_switch_env` in
`.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` so downstream tools can read the contract
without hardcoding the string. Each kill switch and spend cap ceiling
is defined per-workload in `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` so the bench
harness and CI both enforce the same limits.

Adding a new long-running workload:

1. Append a `[[workload]]` block to `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` with
   the three budgets and an owner.
2. Update the "Budgets and kill-switches" table above with the
   summary row.
3. Make the bench binary honor `REDLINEDB_BENCH_KILL` at the same
   poll boundary other workloads use (today: each repetition tick).

## Release readiness — launch-gate evidence

Test evidence rolls into the release-readiness gate documented in
[`docs/release.md`](release.md). The launch gates that every
tagged release must satisfy:

- **Security** — `just security` (cargo audit, cargo deny,
  gitleaks) green; the `security` job in
  `.github/workflows/jankurai.yml` blocks the PR otherwise.
  `bash ops/ci/security-receipt.sh` on the candidate writes
  `target/security/receipt.json`; see
  [`docs/security-scans.md`](security-scans.md).
- **Backups** — kernel `Engine::backup` integration test green
  (`cargo test -p redlinedb-kernel backup`); restore round-trip
  proven by the failpoint matrix lane.
- **Monitoring** — bench `kill_receipt.json` plus
  `.jankurai/repo-score.json` archived per release; the
  audit upload step in `jankurai.yml` is the canonical artifact.
- **Rollback** — releases are never deleted or replaced: a defective
  release is superseded by a corrected one (`docs/release.md`, "Evidence and
  rollback"), and nothing is published to crates.io; `release-bad-behavior`
  lane in `.jankurai/proof-lanes.toml`.
- **Abuse controls** — FFI input boundary tests
  (`cargo test -p redlinedb-ffi shell`) plus the authz matrix lane
  cover misuse of the C ABI from untrusted callers.

These five gates fulfill the audit's `release readiness` evidence
requirement (HLT-025). The release-process steps themselves live
in `docs/release.md`; this section is the testing-side index.

## Budgets, quotas, stop conditions, and kill-switches for paid operations

Canonical source: [`.jankurai/cost-budget.toml`](../.jankurai/cost-budget.toml).
The TOML is machine-readable truth; this section is the agent-facing
operations index for the gates in that file. Audit reference:
HLT-026 cost-budget-gap.

**Scope:** every paid or unbounded operation in this repo (benchmarks,
chaos workloads, CI jobs that fan out matrices) is bounded by an
explicit budget, a quota, a stop condition, and a kill-switch.

- **Max wall-clock per bench run.** Aggregate CI cap is
  `[bench].max_wall_clock_seconds = 1800` (30 minutes). Per-workload
  caps live in each `[[workload]]` block as `max_wall_clock_minutes`
  and bound a single invocation.
- **Max CI concurrent jobs.** `[bench].max_ci_concurrent_jobs = 4`.
  CI matrices that fan out wider than this must shard explicitly or
  serialize behind a job-level `concurrency:` key.
- **Kill-switch (CTRL-C / timeout).** Set `REDLINEDB_BENCH_KILL=1`
  before launching (or `export` mid-run) and the bench harness exits
  at the next workload boundary, flushes in-flight metrics, and
  writes `kill_receipt.json` next to the run output. The env var
  name is fixed under `[global].kill_switch_env`. For hard kills
  use `timeout <seconds> just <lane>` to bound wall-clock from the
  shell side, or `Ctrl-C` (SIGINT) to interrupt the current
  workload iteration.
- **Dry-run a benchmark without exceeding the budget.** Use the
  lowest-rep certify (e.g. `just phase9-smoke`, or
  `cargo run -p redlinedb-bench --release -- certify --config <toml>
  --seed 7 --repetitions 1 --warmup 0`; a debug build refuses to certify
  unless `--allow-debug-build` marks the run a diagnostic) with `REDLINEDB_BENCH_KILL=1`
  pre-exported to force exit at the first iteration boundary; the
  resulting `kill_receipt.json` confirms the wiring without paying
  the full budget. Always inspect the matching `[[workload]]` block
  in `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` before launching a longer run.
- **Quotas (dependency + license).** `[dependencies]` in the budget
  file pins `max_advisory_count = 0` and a license allowlist; any
  PR that introduces a new vulnerable or non-allowlisted dependency
  is rejected by `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` in the security lane.
- **Paid operations register.** All CI lanes that bill compute time
  (bench matrices, cross-engine certification, xbabe1 runs) declare
  a `max_wall_clock_seconds` in their `[[workload]]` block and a
  kill-switch env var. There are no unbounded paid operations in
  this repo; if one is added it must register a budget + stop
  condition here and in `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` before merging.
