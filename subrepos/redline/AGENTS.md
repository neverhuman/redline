<!-- GitHub authority -->
This is an included component of [neverhuman/RedlineDB](https://github.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB).
Use the canonical checkout, root GitHub workflows, and `scripts/ci-family.sh`.
Keep this component's Cargo workspace independent. Root `AGENTS.md` governs source and releases.

# RedlineDB Agent Router

## Workspace Boundary

- Mutate source only in the claimed canonical checkout.
- Never switch to sibling clones, archives, backups, resolved symlink targets, or duplicate roots.
- Never create repo copies or side folders outside the active repo; preserve work with git branches.
- Before edits, report `pwd`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, and `git status --short --branch`.
- Use GitHub pull requests in `neverhuman/RedlineDB`; root workflows are authoritative.

## Git Worktree Policy — MANDATORY

**Never create a Git worktree anywhere, for any reason.**

Rules:
1. Work only in the claimed canonical checkout.
2. If that checkout is dirty or held, wait for an explicit clean stopped-head handoff before
   changing its branch, index, or files.
3. Exact-SHA isolation uses only an automatically removed standalone `git clone --no-local`
   sandbox that is never registered with `git worktree`.
4. If `git worktree list` shows a foreign registration, observe and coordinate it with its holder;
   never remove, prune, move, or otherwise mutate it yourself.

Mission: keep invariants local, edit the smallest lawful surface, and preserve raw evidence.

Access contract: use `gh pr ... --repo neverhuman/RedlineDB` and GitHub authentication.

Start here:
- `.jankurai/owner-map.json`
- `.jankurai/test-map.json`
- `.jankurai/proof-lanes.toml`
- `.jankurai/generated-zones.toml`
- `.jankurai/unsafe-ledger.toml`
- `docs/audit-rubric.md` · `docs/language-bad-behavior.md` · `docs/testing.md`
- `docs/architecture.md` · `docs/boundaries.md`

Rules:
- Prefer package-scoped edits over workspace-wide edits.
- Never hand-edit paths listed in `.jankurai/generated-zones.toml`.
- Keep active source files under 2,000 LOC; split or archive anything larger.
- Do not compress away exit codes, failing test names, panic text, spans, advisory IDs, seeds, raw-log paths, or raw-log hashes.
- Treat `just fast` as the default proof lane, then widen only when the edit crosses contract, security, or concurrency boundaries.
