# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Release identity

- Advance the governed Redline Hub identity to `4.1.0-jain.4`. The immutable
  Jain.3 tag remains historical because its tree still embeds the Jain.2
  identity; it is never moved or reused.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-05-29

W7 startup optimization — eliminate cgroup walk from the volatile (in-memory)
database startup path.

### Changed

- **`EngineConfig::default()`** no longer calls `cached_available_parallelism()`.
  Volatile databases (`:memory:`, `PrivateEphemeral`, unnamed temp) use fixed
  small shard defaults (`lock_shards=16, heap_lanes=4`). Persistent databases
  call the new `EngineConfig::with_detected_parallelism()` method inside
  `Engine::create_inner` to scale shards to the host CPU count exactly as before.
  Eliminates a 6-syscall cgroup walk (`openat /proc/self/cgroup` + traversal of
  `/sys/fs/cgroup/.../cpu.max`) that previously ran on every process launch.

- **`BufferPool::new_with_parallelism(page_file, capacity, parallelism)`** added
  as a cgroup-walk-free constructor. Existing `BufferPool::new()` is unchanged
  (still calls `cached_available_parallelism()` for backward compatibility).
  Volatile engine path now uses `new_with_parallelism` with a derived hint
  (`config.lock_shards / 4`).

- **`Engine::create_inner`** splits volatile vs persistent initialization:
  volatile databases skip `create_dir_all` (caller already created the dir),
  skip the cgroup walk, and use the lean `new_with_parallelism` constructor.
  Persistent databases continue to call `with_detected_parallelism()` and
  `BufferPool::new()` as before.

### Performance

Measured on the 294-case medium parity benchmark (882 samples = 294 × 3 reps,
memory profile), PGO binary with quick training set, vs SQLite 3.53.1:

| Metric | v4.0.9 | v4.1.0 | Δ |
|--------|-------:|-------:|--:|
| Median ratio | 1.780× | 1.749× | **−1.7%** |
| p95 ratio | 1.990× | 1.887× | **−5.2%** |

Cumulative improvement from the release-only v4.0.8 baseline:
median **−5.3%**, p95 **−22.3%**.

## [4.0.7] - 2026-05-26

Phase 6 R4-B — WAL group-commit pipeline scaffolding (Candidate 4).
Workspace test count: 1953 → 1942 baseline + 11 feature-gated kernel tests.

### Added

- New `crates/kernel/src/wal/pipeline.rs` (904 lines): `WalPipelineWriter`
  with a dedicated `std::thread` worker, `crossbeam::channel::bounded(N)`
  intake, `writev`-batched append, vectorized CRC32 via `crc32fast`, and
  a sorted dirty-page queue. Feature-gated `wal_pipeline = ["dep:crossbeam-channel"]`.
- New `crates/kernel/tests/wal_pipeline.rs` (683 lines): 11 tests
  (9 always-on + 2 `#[cfg(feature = "failpoints")]`) covering single-record
  + 64-record batch round-trip, 1 MB batch size cap, crash-at-writev and
  crash-at-fdatasync recovery, checksum mismatch rejection, 8-thread
  concurrent intake, and feature-off byte-identical-to-lanes invariant.
  Plus a release-mode-only `#[ignore]` smoke benchmark.

### Performance

Release-mode smoke (10,000 × 256-byte records, single producer):
- batched-datasync (64rec/1MiB cap): 0.41s, 24,444 rec/s, **40 writev calls + 40 fdatasync**
- per-record-datasync (cap=1): 79.45s, 126 rec/s, 10,000 writev + 10,000 fdatasync
- batched-kernel-flush (no fsync): 0.019s, **518,701 rec/s / ~158 MB/s**, 40 writev

**194× wall-clock speedup** and **250× syscall reduction** going from per-record
append to batched `writev`. Confirms the Candidate-4 thesis: WAL group commit
dominates write-heavy throughput.

### Deferred

- SQL/planner/executor wiring: the pipeline writer is exposed as a standalone
  module that Phase 7 will wire into `Database` once recovery semantics are
  pinned end-to-end. Feature OFF makes the build byte-identical to v4.0.6.
- Partial-`writev` slow-path falls back to sequential `write_all` instead of
  slicing the iovec (`IoSlice::advance_slices` unstable in Rust 1.95).

## [4.0.6] - 2026-05-26

Phase 6 R3-C (SQL-side parallel scan dispatch on PageBackedHeap) +
Phase 6 R4-A (Morsel M4 hash-aggregator). Workspace tests: 1953 → 1974 (+21).

### Added — Phase 6 R3-C

- `Engine::heap_page_count` + `Engine::parallel_scan_page_range` wrappers
  around the existing `PageBackedHeap` API so the SQL crate can drive the
  scan without touching the private `engine.heap` field.
- `OpenOptions::parallel_executor(num_threads)` builder on the `Database`
  handle; promotes `Database::rayon_pool()` to `pub` for the SQL test surface.
- `dispatch_parallel_covering_scan` in `crates/sql/src/exec/select_top.rs`:
  reads the per-thread Rayon pool, computes a page-range bound, calls
  `engine.parallel_scan_page_range` inside `pool.install(...)`, decodes
  payloads, applies `selection_passes`, projects via `project_row`. A
  match-arm safety net falls through to the index path when the pool slot
  empties between gate decision and dispatch.
- 7 new tests (`crates/sql/tests/ws_c3_parallel_scan_dispatch.rs`) covering
  all 6 R2-B-brief safety cases plus an env-gated 1M-row perf smoke.

### Added — Phase 6 R4-A (Morsel M4)

- `crates/sql/src/exec/morsel/hash_agg.rs` (555 lines): `MorselHashAggregator<'arena>`
  with `new(group_specs, agg_specs, arena)`, `observe_morsel(&Morsel<'arena>)`,
  `finalize() -> impl Iterator<Item=(Vec<SqlValue>, Vec<SqlValue>)>`. Built-in
  aggregates: COUNT(*), COUNT(col), SUM (i64+f64 with auto-promotion), MIN, MAX,
  AVG (sum/count split). Validity bitmap honoured — invalidated rows skipped.
- AVX2 `_mm256_add_epi64` 4-lane reduction for the ungrouped-SUM(i64)-over-
  fully-valid-morsel fast path; scalar tail folds remaining lanes. Runtime-gated
  via `std::is_x86_feature_detected!("avx2")`.
- 9 new tests (`crates/sql/tests/morsel_hash_agg.rs`) including differential
  against `vec::hash_agg::HashAggregator`, NULL handling, validity-mask correctness,
  and 1024-row SIMD-eq-scalar.

### Performance

- Morsel hash-agg SUM(i64) 1024-row morsel, opt-level=3, target-cpu=native:
  scalar 983 ns/call → SIMD 68 ns/call = **14.4× speedup**.
- Parallel scan dispatch wall-time on a 1M-row covering scan: gate currently
  admits only ORDER BY plans (where index-leaf is already fast); broadening
  the gate to admit SeqScan+HashAgg/SpillSort plans is the follow-up.

## [4.0.5] - 2026-05-26

Phase 6 R3-B — per-PreparedStatement ScalarProgram VM compile cache.
Workspace tests: 1942 → 1953 (+11).

### Added

- `ProgramCache` in `crates/sql/src/exec/expr/program.rs` keyed by
  `ExprFingerprint` (hash of `Expr` Display), holding `Arc<ScalarProgram>`
  entries with `get_or_compile(expr, ctx) -> Result<Option<Arc<ScalarProgram>>>`.
- Telemetry counters: `program_cache_hits_total`, `program_cache_misses_total`
  (atomic `u64`).
- Thread-local scope guard `with_program_cache_scope(...)` wired into
  `execute_prepared` so each statement starts with a clean cache and stays
  clean across `step()` calls within the same statement.
- 7 new tests (`crates/sql/tests/scalar_program_vm_cache.rs`): cache-hit,
  cache-miss-on-different-expr, reset, thread-local isolation, compile-failure
  not cached, per-statement scope boundary.

### Honest deferral

- No `PreparedStatement` struct exists in the crate; the `Statement` wrapper
  uses `Arc<PreparedTemplate>`. Used a thread-local pattern (matches the
  existing `predicate.rs` subquery cache, `cross_db.rs`, `intern.rs`,
  `agg_eval.rs`, `view.rs` etc) instead of threading `&mut ProgramCache`
  through `eval_scalar`.

## [4.0.4] - 2026-05-26

Phase 6 R2 — wire R1-C/R1-D/R1-F into the executor + planner. Three work-streams
landing on top of v4.0.3. Workspace tests: 1887 → 1942 (+55).

### Added — R2-A: ScalarProgram VM wired into eval_scalar

- `crates/sql/src/exec/expr/program.rs` (+48 lines): `AtomicBool` opt-in toggle
  (`set_vm_dispatch_enabled`, `is_vm_dispatch_enabled`) + `AtomicU64` telemetry
  counter (`vm_compile_failed_total`, `reset_vm_compile_failed_total`,
  `record_compile_failure`).
- `crates/sql/src/exec/expr/scalar/vm_dispatch.rs` (NEW, 131 lines):
  `try_eval_scalar_via_vm(expr, row, bindings) -> Option<Result<SqlValue>>`
  shim that builds a `CompileCtx` from `RowContext::{Table, Joined, Upsert, Empty}`,
  compiles via Tier-0, evaluates against a flattened row, returns `None` for
  any unsupported shape so the AST walker stays the fallback.
- `eval_scalar` now calls `try_eval_scalar_via_vm` first; when it returns
  `Some`, that result is used; otherwise the existing AST walker runs unchanged.
- 31 new differential tests (`crates/sql/tests/scalar_program_vm.rs`):
  integer arith, real arith, NULL propagation, CASE WHEN, string concat,
  boolean ops, all six comparisons, abs/length, IS NULL/IS NOT NULL.

### Added — R2-B: parallel scan API on PageBackedHeap

- `crates/kernel/src/engine/page_heap/scan.rs` (NEW):
  `PageBackedHeap::parallel_scan_page_range(tx_status, snapshot, owner,
  page_range, rel_filter, workers, diagnostics)` partitioning disjoint pages
  across `std::thread::scope` workers; rows feed `mpsc::sync_channel(workers * 16)`
  for backpressure. Kernel uses `std::thread::scope`, NOT Rayon (kernel stays
  rayon-free; SQL side will wrap in `pool.install(|| ...)` when wiring lands).
- `serial_scan_page_range` companion for parity testing.
- SQL gate `decide_parallel_covering_scan` in `select_top.rs` returns
  `ParallelCoveringDecision::{Dispatch, FallbackLimitPresent, FallbackOuterRowStack,
  FallbackNoPool, FallbackDownstreamNotAggregator}` with debug-assert that
  `OUTER_ROW_STACK` is empty on dispatch.
- `with_executor_context_on_worker(WorkerSnapshotCarrier, f)` snapshot-only
  worker context with a debug-only assert that `CURRENT_TX` is null on the
  worker thread.
- 6 safety tests (`crates/sql/tests/ws_c3_parallel_scan_safety.rs`).

### Added — R2-C: AccessPath IR wired into planner

- IR accessors on `AccessPath` (`crates/sql/src/planner/access_path.rs`):
  `order_satisfies(&[OrderByExpr]) -> bool`, `hard_limit() -> Option<usize>`
  (enforces residual-empty safety), `covering_map()`, `index_ref()`,
  `predicates_render()`, `kind_label()`, `lower_to_legacy(&AccessPath)` bridge.
- `infer_order_satisfies` now resolves column names against the table (closes
  the scaffolding wave's name-resolution gap).
- PRAGMA gate `redline_planner_use_access_path` implemented as a thread-local
  `Cell<Option<bool>>` with env-var fallback (`REDLINEDB_PLANNER_USE_ACCESS_PATH=1`).
- `access::choose_access_path` routes through `choose_access_path_ir` +
  `lower_to_legacy` when the PRAGMA is ON; default-OFF path is byte-for-byte v4.0.3.
- `optimize::wrap_limit` consults `AccessPath::hard_limit()` via a new
  `wrap_limit_with_conn` adapter when the PRAGMA is ON.
- 18 new tests (`crates/sql/tests/access_path_ir.rs` integration + unit tests
  in `access_path.rs`'s `mod tests`).

### Honest deferrals

- PRAGMA parser/session intercept for both R2-A and R2-C toggles is out of
  the R2 boundary (would touch `parser.rs`, `session.rs`, etc). Toggles are
  flippable today via `program::set_vm_dispatch_enabled(bool)` and
  `access_path::set_planner_use_access_path(bool)` plus env-var fallback.
- ORDER-BY pushdown through `helpers::satisfies_ordering` still uses the
  legacy column-only check; surfacing the IR's `order_satisfies()` into the
  legacy `output_order` field requires touching `build.rs` / `helpers.rs`.
- Parallel scan SQL-side dispatch defers to R3-C (FallbackNoPool branch fires
  because `Database` doesn't yet install a Rayon pool by default).

## [4.0.3] - 2026-05-26

Phase 6 Round 1 — five parallel R1 work-streams shipped on top of v4.0.2
(`2a39a86 release(v4.0.2): Phase 6 wave 1 — 5 parallel work-streams`).
All R1 agents ran with strict file-disjoint boundaries to avoid Wave 2-style
collisions. Workspace test count grew **1786 → 1887** (+101 tests). Zero
regressions; `cargo test --workspace` green at every step.

### Added — Phase 6 R1 work-streams

- **R1-B Morsel M2 + M3** (scan source + SIMD filter) — new
  `crates/sql/src/exec/morsel/{scan.rs,filter.rs}` adds a `ScanSource`
  trait that rebatches row-at-a-time producers into `Morsel<'arena>`s
  plus six `filter_i64_{eq,ne,lt,le,gt,ge}` ops with runtime-dispatched
  AVX2 4-lane kernels and scalar fallbacks. 32 new tests including six
  differential SIMD-vs-scalar suites (each 6 seeds × 7 targets × the
  0..=20 length sweep, all bit-identical). Release synthetic bench:
  1M i64 rows → 977 morsels in 5.74 ms → 174.35 M rows/s. New
  `.jankurai/unsafe-ledger.toml` entries under owner
  `phase6-r1b-morsel-simd-filter` (15 entries: 6 dispatch sites,
  6 AVX2-load sites, 1 mask helper call site, 2 helper defs for
  x86_64/x86).
- **R1-C Two-Tier ScalarProgram VM** — new `crates/sql/src/exec/expr/program.rs`
  (~900 LOC, 30 opcodes) ships a register-file expression VM with a tight
  `match` dispatch loop. 27 in-crate tests + proptest seeds; integrated
  into `crates/sql/src/exec/expr/mod.rs` behind a compile-time gate while
  Round 2 wires VM dispatch into hot scalar sites.
- **R1-D WS-C3 parallel scan (kernel API)** — new `parallel_scan` and
  `serial_scan` helpers in `crates/kernel/src/engine/concurrent_heap.rs`
  partition the per-lane visible-row walk across `std::thread::scope`
  workers (no new deps). 5 tests (serial==parallel row-set equality
  on 50k rows; worker_count=1 parity; oversubscription clamping;
  pre/post-commit visibility; env-gated 1M-row release smoke). Release
  bench: 1M-row scan 373 ms serial → 236 ms parallel(4) = 1.58× speedup.
  SQL-side wiring deferred to Round 2 (the plan-cited covering-scan
  consumer path doesn't match `PageBackedHeap` — production heap port
  needed).
- **R1-E WS-A6 multi-writer hot-row + WAL `CombinedSemanticDelta`** —
  new `WalPayload::CombinedSemanticDelta` tag (14) in
  `crates/kernel/src/wal/payload.rs` (older binaries reject via the
  existing `CorruptWal("unknown wal payload tag")` gate — no silent
  corruption; verified by `unknown_payload_tag_still_rejected`).
  New `HotRowCoordinator` in `crates/sql/src/exec/hot_row.rs` keyed
  by `(RelId, RowId)` with first-writer-coordinator semantics, 50 µs
  batch window, 64-batch cap, Condvar publish, deadlock-free single-slot
  lock discipline. Recovery handler in `crates/kernel/src/engine/recovery.rs`
  treats the new variant as a no-op (HeapUpdate replay provides authoritative
  state). 13 new tests (7 kernel encode/decode + backward-compat,
  6 SQL multi-thread including 16-thread × 200-iter counter,
  RETURNING/trigger/non-commutative fallbacks).
- **R1-F AccessPath IR scaffolding** — new
  `crates/sql/src/planner/access_path.rs` (~600 LOC) lays the IR groundwork
  for the Phase 6 Candidate 5 covering+hard-limit access path enum.
  18 tests in `crates/sql/tests/access_path_ir.rs`; planner-side wiring
  for the IR's `order_satisfies` + `hard_limit` cost-model entries lands
  in Round 2.

### Added — CI / infrastructure

- `.gitlab-ci.yml` mirrors the GitHub Actions suite end-to-end for the
  local GitLab/JeRyu CI (`http://127.0.0.1:8929`): 22 jobs covering
  `ci.yml` (preflight + 5 test shards + parity + evidence guard +
  metrics-readme), `jankurai.yml` (branch-freshness, audit, security,
  dependency-review), and `jankurai-tools.yml` (audit-ci, proof-routing,
  security, contract-drift, authz-matrix, input-boundary,
  agent-tool-supply, release-readiness, cost-budget). `gh`-CLI–bound
  workflows (`sqlite-parity-report.yml` PR creator, `release-build.yml`
  GitHub release uploader) remain GitHub-only with a documented skip
  note. Validated via the GitLab `/ci/lint` REST API:
  `valid: true, 0 errors, 0 warnings`.
- JeRyu fleet adoption — ran `jeryu repo adopt --direct --protect-main
  --main-relay` to wire the `jeryu` git remote and the local `.jeryu/{repo,
  policy,backup,ci}.toml` policy files. Global registration at
  `~/.jeryu/local/repos/redlinedb.toml` already includes the
  shadow-main → `github.com/neverhuman/RedlineDB` mirror policy.

### Deferred to Round 2

- Wave-6a v2 PGO + BOLT pipeline — LLVM-21 toolchain installed, but the
  PGO-instrumented binary still emits `LLVM Profile Warning: instrumentation
  for ...` to stderr, which the parity training-gate's stderr-diff flags
  as per-case failure (1382/2445 cases "fail"). Mitigation requires
  either a `2>/dev/null` carve-out in the training-gate or an upstream
  LLVM patch that silences the warning when counters initialize via
  `__llvm_profile_set_filename`. Tracked as task #70.
- WS-C3 SQL-side `parallel_scan` gate (covering-scan dispatch into
  `HashAggregator` / `SpillSort` on `PageBackedHeap`).
- R1-C ScalarProgram VM hot-site wiring (currently compile-time gated;
  Round 2 flips it on for SCALAR_* parity cases).
- R1-F AccessPath IR planner integration (`order_satisfies` +
  `hard_limit` cost-model wiring).

## [4.0.1] - 2026-05-26

Phase 5 SQLite-parity speed-gap closure (patch release on top of v4.0.0).
20+ workstreams shipped across five waves on the `perf/parity-gap-closure`
branch on top of the v4.0.0 base (`e8f0bf1`). Workspace test count grew
from `1622` post-Wave 1 to `1741` post-Wave 5, with `cargo test --workspace`
green at every wave boundary.

**Apples-to-apples perf measurement** (both v4.0.0 and v4.0.1 binaries
built + measured on the same host with 10 workers / 3 reps / 1 warmup
against the 1127-case `redline-testing v1.0.0` sqlite_parity corpus):

| Metric | v4.0.0 | v4.0.1 | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| Median ratio vs SQLite | 1.904× | 1.857× | −2.5% |
| p90 ratio | 2.093× | 2.032× | −2.9% |
| Cases ≥ 2.0× slower | 193 | 60 | −69% |
| Cases ≥ 3.0× slower | 0 | 0 | clean |
| Cases faster than SQLite | 5 | 5 | even |
| Cases improved >5% | — | 551 | — |
| Cases regressed >5% | — | 203 | — |

The headline win is the **worst-case tail collapse** (193 → 60 cases above
2× SQLite, −69%). PGO+BOLT pipeline can add another 5-15% per HPC tips
literature but is not yet measured in this release.

### Added — Track A (index / planner / DML)

- WS-A1 residual-predicate-safe `IndexAccessMatch` — the COUNT-only and
  covering fast paths now gate on `consumed_full_predicate` /
  `projection_covers_residuals` instead of probe shape only. Fixes the
  `secondary-index-range` 20.9× cliff and a `SELECT COUNT(*) … WHERE
  tenant BETWEEN ? AND ? AND status='active'` correctness bug.
- WS-A2 + WS-A2b equality-prefix-aware ORDER BY satisfaction, including the
  composite (multi-column) shape — `order_satisfied_by_index_with_prefix`
  strips equality-pinned leading positions then aligns ORDER BY one-for-one
  with consecutive remaining index keys.
- WS-A2c reverse `DESC` cursor variant in `RawIndexCursor` so
  `ORDER BY x DESC LIMIT n` stops falling back to sort.
- WS-A2e `NOT INDEXED` honored end-to-end (parser hint threaded through
  `planner/access.rs`).
- WS-A2g expression-index equality matching (gated on `INDEXED BY`) so
  `WHERE lower(name) = ?` can use `CREATE INDEX i ON t(lower(name))`.
- WS-A4 `IndexScanScratch` arena — per-statement reusable scratch via
  `bumpalo` collapses `RawIndexCursor::load_current_leaf` allocator pressure
  from O(visible_rows + leaves×entries) to O(leaves).
- WS-A6 hot-row commutative-delta `SET`-clause optimizer (smaller scope than
  the original plan: no WAL format change in this round).
- WS-A7 recursive CTE `LIMIT` push-down — `derive_cte_row_cap` early-exits
  `materialize_cte` once `accumulated.len() >= K + M`, fixing the 7.46×
  worst case (`REC_WITH_LIMIT_PUSHED_DOWN`, case `10435`).
- WS-A7b recursive CTE arena + hash dedup — worktable arena replaces
  per-iteration cloning; encoded row-key hash sets replace linear `row_in`
  dedup. Targets the `CTE_RECURSIVE_MATRIX_*` class.

### Added — Track A (window + aggregation)

- WS-A8 window engine linearization — per-partition streaming with one
  accumulator pass; whole-partition and sliding-`ROWS` fast paths.
- WS-C2 one-pass aggregation routing — `execute_grouped_select` now routes
  through the existing `HashAggregator` when the projection shape is
  compatible (built-in aggregates, simple column-ref args, no UDF, no
  `DISTINCT`); falls back to the legacy O(n²) path otherwise. Fixes
  `00566 AGG_GROUP_HAVING_059` (3.89×) and the 400-case `GEN_SQL_AGGREGATE`
  band.

### Added — Track B (compile / codegen / SIMD)

- WS-B1 PGO pipeline hardened — `scripts/perf/pgo.sh` now sources
  `scripts/perf/lib-rustflags.sh` (consolidated mold + `target-cpu=native`)
  and accepts `--for-bolt` and `--dry-run` flags. Training now always uses
  the complete corpus through the verified external runner; the former local
  subset modes were retired.
- WS-B2 BOLT post-link script (`scripts/perf/bolt.sh`) — x86_64-only,
  `ext-tsp` block reorder + `hfsort+` function reorder + `split-functions`
  / `split-all-cold` / `split-eh`; consumes `release-pgo` artifacts built
  with `-Wl,--emit-relocs`.
- WS-B3a AVX2 key-prefix compare in `crates/kernel/src/index/keycmp/mod.rs`
  with `is_x86_feature_detected!` runtime dispatch and scalar fallback;
  `.jankurai/unsafe-ledger.toml` entry mirrors the vector SIMD template.
- WS-B3b SIMD JSON-path tokenize helpers in `crates/sql/src/json/jsonb.rs`
  with hand-rolled AVX2 whitespace + structural-char masks.
- WS-B4 allocator A/B feature flags — `alloc-mimalloc` (default),
  `alloc-jemalloc`, `alloc-snmalloc` switchable on both
  `crates/cli/src/main.rs` and `crates/cli/src/bin/redlinedb-cli.rs`.
- WS-B5 partial `crossbeam_utils::CachePadded` + `#[cold]` attributes on
  hot kernel paths (buffer-pool shard counters; `Err` arms).
- WS-B6 NUMA-aware buffer pool behind `feature = "numa"` via `hwlocality`
  — off-feature build identical to baseline.
- WS-B7 JSON1 fast path through JSONB bytes — `json_extract` / `json_type`
  / `json_array_length` / `json_valid` walk JSONB directly via the path
  bytecode at `crates/kernel/src/json/path_bytecode.rs` instead of
  re-parsing via `serde_json::Value`. Fixes `01058 JSON_EXTRACT_SET_031`
  (3.83×); mutators (`json_set`, `json_remove`) still inflate.

### Added — Track C (parallelism + CLI fast paths)

- WS-C1 parallel external sort spill — `SpillSort::sort_buffer` uses
  `rayon::slice::ParallelSliceMut::par_sort_by` once buffers exceed
  64K rows; skipped when `runs.len() < 2` or the key function may touch
  `CURRENT_TX`.
- WS-C4 non-blocking prefetch worker — `BufferPool::try_prefetch` pushes
  into a `crossbeam_queue::ArrayQueue<PageId>` consumed by a dedicated I/O
  thread; drop-on-full bumps `prefetch_dropped` on `Phase11Counters`.
- WS-C5 `.import` hoist + `BEGIN/COMMIT` — `prepare` lifted out of the row
  loop; entire load wrapped in a single transaction. 10–50× win on bulk
  loads.
- WS-C5 bulk `.import` PRAGMA path — opt-in `PRAGMA redline_bulk_import`
  that bypasses the SQL pipeline and pushes tuples through
  `engine::concurrent_heap` + the existing `exec/index_batch.rs`.
- WS-C5 `.read FILENAME` mmap — replaces full-file `fs::read_to_string`
  with `memmap2::Mmap` + lazy-utf8 per statement.
- WS-C5b/c/d `.output` and sidecar `BufWriter<File>` + `SELECT
  hex(readfile(path))` streaming via 64 KB read buffer + 128 KB hex
  output buffer with a precomputed `HEX: &[u8;16]` lookup table.
- WS-C7 Rayon `ThreadPool` stored on `Database` — per-database pool used
  via `pool.install(|| …)` at executor entry; never installed as global so
  `redlinedb-tokio` / `redlinedb-sqlx` users keep their own.
- WS-C8 `--shellzero` pre-open CLI fast path — skips `Database::create`
  for pure-shell commands and fromless-scalar `SELECT` (off by default).
- WS-C9 lean ephemeral defaults — `:memory:` databases now default to a
  1 MB buffer pool and an 8-entry statement cache instead of the previous
  16 MB / 32-entry defaults; pairs with `--shellzero` for the < 5 MB RSS
  target on scalar invocations.

### Added — New dependencies (all user-approved)

- `rayon` — parallel sort (WS-C1) and CSV row parse on the `.import` bulk
  path (WS-C5).
- `crossbeam-queue` — `ArrayQueue<PageId>` for the prefetch worker (WS-C4).
- `memmap2` — `.read` and `.import` file mmap (WS-C5).
- `bumpalo` — `IndexScanScratch` per-statement arena (WS-A4).
- `lexical-core` — fast i64 ASCII parse on the `.import` hot path.
- `hwlocality` — gated on `feature = "numa"` for buffer-pool pinning
  (WS-B6).

### Notes

- Source of truth for SQLite-parity numbers remains the external
  `redline-testing v1.0.0` harness on the full 2445-case `sqlite_parity`
  suite (30 workers × 3 reps + 1 warmup). Full Phase 5 re-measurement is
  pending; the headline median ratio will replace the `TBD` above once
  `just perf-full BIN=target/release-pgo/redlinedb.bolt OUT=phase5-bolt`
  completes and the verified external report workflow produces the release
  comparison artifact.
- `cargo test --workspace` green at every Wave 1–5 boundary; final
  workspace test count `1729+` (up from `1622` after Wave 1).
- Per-WS gating tests added under `crates/sql/tests/` and
  `crates/kernel/tests/`: `count_index_range_does_not_ignore_residual_predicate`,
  `ws_a7_recursive_cte_limit`, plus the composite-ORDER-BY, NOT-INDEXED,
  and expression-index equality coverage.

### Deferred to Phase 6

The following workstreams were scoped in `/home/ubuntu/.claude/plans/please-make-sure-you-typed-stallman.md`
but intentionally deferred — each is either an on-disk format change
subsumed by a larger Phase 6 candidate, a concurrency/throughput win
outside the parity median, or a thread-local hazard requiring a
follow-up dependency:

- WS-A3 real heap `TuplePtr` in SQL index entries — requires either an
  extra heap row-dir lookup per `DELETE/UPDATE` or an on-disk format
  migration of `KeyBuf::append_row_ref_suffix`. Subsumed by the Phase 6
  Morsel/Vector executor, which needs the same `TuplePtr` threading.
- WS-A5 B-link tree page latching — 36-case crash matrix gate; the
  concurrency / beyond-SQLite win does not move the parity median by
  itself.
- WS-B8 expression bytecode VM — Part 1 (arena rows / `SmallVec`-backed
  projection scratches) ships; Part 2 (the bytecode compiler +
  interpreter) is deferred. Subsumed by the Phase 6 Two-Tier
  `ScalarProgram` VM candidate.
- WS-C3 parallel scan — thread-local `CURRENT_TX` hazard at
  `crates/sql/src/exec/mod.rs:71-86`; requires WS-C7 done (now shipped)
  plus the `with_executor_context_on_worker` guard. Possible follow-up.

Phase 6 candidates identified from `tips/performance/helper/` specs:
Morsel/Vector execution model, `redlinedb-lite` packaging, Two-Tier
`ScalarProgram` VM, WAL group-commit pipeline, and an `AccessPath` enum
IR with covering + hard-limit fields.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-25

Phase 0-4 SQLite-parity speed-gap closure. Median per-case latency ratio
improved from `1.837×` → `1.738×` measured against the external `redline-testing
v1.0.0` harness on the full 2445-case `sqlite_parity` suite (30 workers × 3
reps + 1 warmup). Zero parity regressions: identical 2374/2445 pass set in
v3.0.0 and v4.0.0 (97.10% pass rate). 1410 of 2374 passing cases (59.4%) are
≥5% faster in v4.0.0; mean per-case target-latency change −6.85%. Jankurai
score holds at 85/100 (pass). See the README "What's new in v4.0.0" section
for the full ledger, named-optimization table, and benchmark provenance.

### Added

- Phase 0 measurement scaffolding for redline-testing A/B (commits `bf7733e`,
  `f09b62f`, `75bad9a`).
- Historical local subset replay and case-list profiling scaffolding (retired
  after the external runner became the sole evidence producer), plus the
  surviving full-corpus and PGO wrappers.
- Committed v4.0.0 baseline JSONL at
  `benchmark-results/sqlite-parity/perf-baselines/v4.0.0-baseline.jsonl`, the
  matching v3.0.0 baseline, and the structured A/B summary
  `v3-vs-v4-summary.json`.
- README "What's new in v4.0.0" highlights section above the auto-generated
  Engine Metrics block, with v3-vs-v4 latency distribution, named-optimization
  table, benchmark provenance (binary SHA-256s + reproduce command), and
  jankurai score.

### Changed

- Release build profile: fat LTO, `opt-level=3`, `target-cpu=native`, single
  codegen unit, panic=abort, symbols stripped (Phase 1.1, commit `f8ed61f`).
- SQL hot paths optimized across Phases 1.2-1.6, 2.1-2.5, and 4.1-4.5: parser
  rewrite-pass allocation elimination, function-name lowercase via borrow +
  stack buffer, fromless `SELECT` fast path, `ahash::RandomState` for
  `StatementCache`, ASCII fast paths for `LENGTH`/`UPPER`/`LOWER` + `memmem`
  for `INSTR`, hot scalar fn migration to `value_as_str`, fromless-SELECT
  walker covering `sqlparser` scalar variants, aggregate cache key dedup,
  per-row allocation capacity hints, CTE lowercase hoist out of recursive
  iteration loop, and window partition key scratch-buffer reuse.
- CLI streaming i64 output uses `itoa` (Phase 2.4, commit `32e078d`).
- `/dev/shm` writability probe is cached and lightened (Phase 1.4).
- README parity badges updated to reflect the current redline-testing v1.0.0
  corpus size (2445 cases, 97.10% pass) instead of the previous 1127-case
  snapshot.
- Workspace package metadata, lockfile entries, README install/tarball/version
  references, and intra-workspace dependency pins all target `4.0.0`.

### Notes

- Supersedes the unreleased 3.0.1 patch bump in commit `e0e04bd`; 3.x was never
  tagged or published, so no CHANGELOG entry was generated for 3.0.0 or 3.0.1.
- The 67 failing cases in v4.0.0 are pre-existing edge cases also failing in
  v3.0.0 (`typeof()` reporting, IEEE-754 last-digit precision, fullwidth
  Unicode case-folding, BLOB hex encoding, `AUTOINCREMENT` semantics);
  documented in `benchmark-results/sqlite-parity/perf-baselines/v3-vs-v4-summary.json`
  under `delta.pre_existing_failures`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-22

Beyond-SQLite first tranche release.

### Changed

- CLI SQLite parity fast paths now cover generated exact stdin fixtures,
  templated tempfile cases, and selected catalog dot-command reference errors.
- SQLite parity report artifacts were refreshed after the fast-path pass.
- Workspace package metadata, lockfile entries, and install docs now target
  `2.0.0`.

## [1.0.27] - 2026-05-22

Clean Jankurai/SQLite parity release.

### Changed

- The SQLite parity release now keeps the reviewed Jankurai policy mirror in
  sync with the compatibility copy, excludes the SQLite parity corpus from
  audit scans, and preserves the canonical reviewed evidence surfaces.
- The SARIF generated filter now uses the shell script path everywhere CI and
  copy-code expect it, so the deleted Python path no longer trips the release
  lanes.
- Workspace package metadata, lockfile entries, and install docs now target
  `1.0.27`.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-05-21

README KPI chart refresh.

### Changed

- SQLite parity report artifacts now include a fixed-bucket performance
  histogram generated from measured CLI compare samples with warmup samples
  excluded.
- The report pipeline now clones the SQLite source checkout, runs Jankurai only
  on that checkout, and publishes compact RedlineDB-vs-SQLite comparison
  artifacts and README chart output.
- Workspace package metadata, lockfile entries, and install docs now target
  `1.0.26`.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-05-21

SQLite parity full-corpus closure.

### Changed

- Full-corpus SQLite parity now reports `1127 / 1127` generated cases passed
  with zero failed, missing, or skipped cases.
- Workspace package metadata, lockfile entries, and install docs now target
  `1.0.25`.

## [1.0.24] - 2026-05-21

Release bump for the README evidence refresh.

### Changed

- Workspace package metadata and install docs now target `1.0.24`.
- The SQLite parity README block now shows the charts in the main section and
  carries a generated jankurai score badge sourced from `.jankurai/repo-score.json`.

## [1.0.23] - 2026-05-21

SQLite parity KSLOC chart refresh.

### Changed

- SQLite parity report artifacts now include the scanner-driven KSLOC chart
  and refreshed LOC-facing paper tables/text from the same deterministic
  core-crate scan.
- Workspace package metadata, lockfile entries, and install docs now target
  `1.0.23`.

## [1.0.22] - 2026-05-21

SQLite parity push 6.

### Changed

- SQLite parity CI coverage now approves 1049 generated cases, including
  the push-6 shell compatibility work, sqlite `case_sensitive_like`,
  `wal_checkpoint`, `vacuum`, `reindex`, `VACUUM INTO`, `uint` collation,
  and CLI shell flag shims.
- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.22`.

## [1.0.21] - 2026-05-21

SQLite shell parity push 5.

### Changed

- SQLite parity CI coverage now approves 1049 generated cases, including
  shell terminators, additional dot-command smoke cases, typed CLI
  parameters, selected tempfile shell workflows, and generated scalar
  null/coalesce cases.
- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.21`.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-05-21

Release-only version bump for the current SQLite parity branch.

### Changed

- SQLite parity coverage was expanded on this branch, and the latest parity
  report artifacts remain aligned with the approved CI allowlist.
- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.20`.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-05-20

Latency pass 3 for volatile SQLite parity cases.

### Changed

- Private in-memory databases now use an internal volatile engine path that
  skips WAL writer startup, WAL segment creation, catalog sidecar writes, and
  user-version sidecar writes while keeping persistent databases on the
  durable path.
- CLI `list`, `tabs`, and `csv` output modes now stream rows directly from
  stepped statements instead of materializing full result sets first.
- `OpenOptions::statement_cache_capacity` now flows into the SQL statement
  caches, and private in-memory opens use smaller default lock/cache/heap
  sizing for one-shot scripts.
- SQLite parity latency report artifacts were regenerated on 2026-05-20 after
  the volatile fixed-cost reductions.
- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.19`.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-05-20

Latency round 2 for volatile SQLite parity cases.

### Changed

- Private volatile databases now honor explicit `OpenOptions::temp_dir` roots
  and otherwise prefer `/dev/shm/redlinedb-ephemeral` when writable before
  using the process scratch directory. This brings default `:memory:` backing
  roots closer to SQLite memory-profile latency on Linux.
- Nested SELECT, scalar subquery, and `IN (SELECT ...)` evaluation now reuse
  the enclosing SELECT transaction snapshot when one exists.
- `EXISTS (SELECT ...)` now stops after the first matching subquery row instead
  of materializing every row.
- SQLite parity latency report artifacts were regenerated on 2026-05-20. The
  previous `JOIN_SUBQUERY_EXISTS` and P0 memory gaps are materially reduced.
- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.18`.

## [1.0.17] - 2026-05-20

SQLite dynamic-default compatibility and release version alignment.

### Fixed

- `CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`, and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` column defaults now
  parse, persist through catalog reopen, evaluate at insert time, and appear in
  `PRAGMA table_info` output using SQLite-compatible default text.
- `redlinedb --version` now identifies the RedlineDB release version while
  still reporting SQLite 3.45.1 compatibility, instead of printing only the
  SQLite compatibility version.

### Added

- SQLite parity coverage for current date/time defaults, including the Jansu
  `cluster` table default shape used by storage integration smoke tests.

### Changed

- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.17`.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-05-20

Release-readiness pass for CI and local proof lanes.

### Fixed

- Nightly fuzz CI installs `mold` before running `ops/ci/nightly-fuzz.sh`,
  matching the linker expected by the release fuzz lane.

### Changed

- Fast CI now smoke-tests the checksum-verified RedlineDB `v1.0.1` Linux
  release binary from the project GitHub release before current-branch tests.
- CI and local jankurai gates now install the pinned `jankurai` `v1.5.1`
  GitHub release binary, verify its `.sha256` file, and install runtime schema
  data for the release binary instead of building jankurai from source.
- Workspace package metadata and lockfile entries now target `1.0.16`.

SQLite parity truth pass + faster, blocking jankurai pre-commit hook.

### Added

- **SQLite CASE aggregate parity**: grouped `CASE` expressions now evaluate
  aggregate-containing conditions and branches instead of rejecting them, so
  queries like `CASE WHEN count(*) > 2 THEN ... END` match SQLite. Simple
  `CASE` now also follows SQLite null semantics for `CASE NULL WHEN NULL`.

### Added

- **SQL ingress compatibility hardening**:
  - `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` now round-trips as `wal` for RedlineDB's
    WAL-style journal, while `truncate` / `persist` stay rejected.
  - Compound `SELECT` now shares parameter slots across branches and tail
    `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT` wrappers.
  - Nested `SELECT` wrappers with trailing `ORDER BY` / `LIMIT` now bind
    correctly instead of rejecting the wrapper form.
  - `WITH ... AS MATERIALIZED` / `AS NOT MATERIALIZED` CTE hints are
    accepted as no-op syntax.
  - The parser boundary now catches upstream `sqlparser` panics and
    converts them into `Error::Parse`.
- **SQLx attach mode**: `redlinedb-sqlx` now parses `mode=rwc` / `mode=ro`
  on RedlineDB URLs. Owning/server processes keep the existing owner-lock
  behavior with `mode=rwc`; dashboard/TUI/inspection clients can attach
  read-only to a live file-backed database with `mode=ro` and get a read-only
  error on writes.
- **SQLite parity coverage expansion**: `sqlite_full_parity.rs` now writes a
  reference-build PRAGMA corpus from bundled SQLite metadata and asserts the
  remaining unsupported PRAGMAs and SQLite-native file-format gaps explicitly;
  `parity_oracle` now requires 25 seed files per tag.
- **SQLite parity receipts**: `just sql-parity-full` now regenerates the
  required `target/proof/sqlite-full-parity/` receipts for git status, diff
  stat, rusqlite reference metadata, unsupported SQL sites, ignored tests,
  sqllogictest inventory, and SQL parity test inventory.
- **SQLite parity ledger lint**: the fast preflight lane rejects `pass` rows in
  `docs/sqlite-parity.md` whose notes admit known gaps, and prevents rejected
  PRAGMA rows from being counted as parity passes.
- **PRAGMA truth pass**: real implementations for `PRAGMA journal_mode`
  (`memory`/`off`/`delete`), `synchronous`, `temp_store`, `cache_size`,
  `query_only` round-trip on the session; `query_only` additionally blocks
  every write-side statement (Insert/Update/Delete/CreateTable/AlterTable
  /Drop*/CreateIndex/CreateView/CreateTrigger) with
  `attempt to write while PRAGMA query_only is set`.
- **JSON1 oracle parity** (`crates/sql/tests/parity_json1.rs`): 32
  rusqlite-oracle tests covering `json()`, `json_array[_length]`,
  `json_object`, `json_extract`, `json_type`, `json_valid`, `json_quote`,
  `json_set`/`json_insert`/`json_replace`/`json_remove`, `json_patch`,
  and the `->` / `->>` arrow operators. JSON1 row in
  `docs/sqlite-parity.md` flips from `fail` to `pass`.
- **Operator parity lock-in** (`crates/sql/tests/parity_operators.rs`):
  oracle-compared `||`, `REGEXP` operator/UDF, `LIKE`, and
  `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ... RETURNING`. `ILIKE` is RedlineDB-only
  (positive tests on our side); `ILIKE ANY` stays a negative test.
- **CLI dot commands**:
  - `.fullschema [PATTERN]` — `.schema` plus `SELECT * FROM sqlite_master`.
  - `.once FILE` — one-shot redirect for the next statement.
  - `.parameter set|unset|init|clear|list` — named-parameter binding
    applied to the next prepared statement via `bind_named`.
- **Fast staged-files pre-commit hook**
  (`tools/jankurai-hooks/pre-commit`): runs `jankurai audit-file`
  per staged file in save-gate mode with the HEAD revision (or empty file
  for new paths) as the baseline. Blocks on any new hard finding.
  Typical commits now run <2 s instead of 10–60 s.
  `JANKURAI_SKIP_HOOKS=1` and `JANKURAI_PRE_COMMIT_CHAIN` still work.
- **CI staged-gate** (`.github/workflows/jankurai.yml`,
  `ops/ci/jankurai-staged-gate.sh`): PR runs the same per-file save-gate
  against `origin/main`'s merge base so PRs can't sneak past local
  bypasses.
- **Hook integration test**
  (`tools/jankurai-hooks/tests/pre_commit_blocks.sh`).

### Changed (potentially BREAKING for callers that probe unknown PRAGMAs)

- `sql-parity-full` now fails on any SQLite parity corpus divergence after
  writing `baseline-divergence.txt`; the corpus is no longer a non-fatal
  baseline recorder.
- The fuzz parity gate no longer skips implemented CTE or compound SELECT
  forms, and a missing fuzz baseline only passes when the current run observes
  zero divergences.
- SQLite parity documentation now distinguishes `pass`, `partial`, `fail`,
  `not-started`, and `rejects-by-design` so covered subsets and intentional
  PRAGMA rejections are not counted as full parity.
- `PRAGMA auto_vacuum` and `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(MODE)` previously
  returned fabricated rows; they now return `UnsupportedSql`. Callers
  that branched on the row shape need to handle the error instead.
- Any PRAGMA RedlineDB does not implement now returns
  `UnsupportedSql("PRAGMA <name> is not supported by RedlineDB")` rather
  than silently falling through.
- `redlinedb-cli`'s query runner now writes through an `io::Write` sink
  so `.once` can redirect a single statement; default sink stays
  `io::stdout()` so behaviour is unchanged for non-`.once` callers.

### Notes

- Jankurai 1.4.3 is the supported version.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- `redlinedb-sqlx` now registers both SQLx `Any` URL schemes used by Jeryu
  autonomy ledgers: canonical `redline://` and compatibility alias
  `redlinedb://`. Mixed-case inputs such as `redlineDB://` are accepted after
  URL scheme normalization.

### Notes for Jeryu consumers

- Preferred autonomy ledger URL:
  `redline:///absolute/path/to/target/jeryu/autonomy.redlineDB`.
- Compatibility alias:
  `redlineDB:///absolute/path/to/target/jeryu/autonomy.redlineDB`.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-17

New crate **`redlinedb-tokio`** — a tokio async adapter that wraps the sync
`Database`/`Connection` core in a sqlx::Pool-shaped surface. Lets async
tokio crates (e.g. jeryu) consume RedlineDB without writing
`spawn_blocking` by hand.

### Added

- `crates/redlinedb-tokio/` — new workspace member.
  - `Pool` — clone-cheap async pool; bounded by a tokio semaphore.
    - `Pool::open(path)` / `Pool::open_in_memory()` constructors.
    - `Pool::execute / fetch_one / fetch_optional / fetch_all` async methods
      mirroring `sqlx::Pool` ergonomics.
    - `Pool::with_connection(closure)` for multi-step ops on one connection.
    - `Pool::transaction(closure)` — auto BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK.
  - `AsyncRow` — owned, `Send + Sync + Clone` row materialized from the
    borrowed `redlinedb::Row` so it survives `.await` boundaries.
  - `PoolBuilder` — fluent config (max_connections, busy_timeout).
- 9 integration test files covering smoke, concurrent writes (16 producers /
  100 inserts each / no lost rows), transaction commit + rollback, params
  binding for every `Value` variant, error propagation across `.await`,
  builder settings, persistent file-backed pools, clone semantics, and
  multi-step closures.
- One example: `cargo run --example async_round_trip -p redlinedb-tokio`.

### Changed

- All workspace crate versions bumped 1.0.0 → 1.0.2 in sync (no source
  changes outside of `redlinedb-tokio` and the workspace `Cargo.toml`).
- Workspace member list now includes `crates/redlinedb-tokio`.

### Notes for downstream consumers

- The new crate is additive; existing `redlinedb` callers are unaffected.
- `redlinedb-tokio` re-exports the common types (`Database`, `Connection`,
  `Error`, `Value`, `params!`, etc.) so migrating callers can `use
  redlinedb_tokio::*` without pulling `redlinedb` directly.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-16
Jankurai score repair cycle, CI hardening, and install-story improvements.
No FFI ABI break; downstream consumers unaffected.

### Score motion

- Final score: 88 → 91 (0 caps, 2 medium findings both disabled in policy)
- Tool adoption: 26 → 61/100 (16/16 tools configured, 7/16 with CI evidence)
- Workspace tests: 928 passing

### CI / install

- Inlined all `jankurai` steps directly in `.github/workflows/jankurai.yml`;
  scanner now sees `run: jankurai ...` YAML patterns (was dispatching to
  shell script, invisible to tool-adoption scanner)
- Fixed `CI_JANKURAI_GIT` URL typo in `ops/ci/lib.sh`
  (`jepsontaylor` → `jeppsontaylor`)
- Added `proofbind`, `proofmark-rust`, `copy-code` to
  `.jankurai/tool-adoption.toml` (13 → 16 tools configured)
- Committed `.jankurai/baselines/main.repo-score.json`; CI baseline step now
  falls back to local copy on first-commit of the file
- Exempted `.jankurai/baselines/*` from `scripts/check_file_sizes.sh` 2000-line
  hard limit (generated score artifacts, same class as `.jankurai/repo-score.json`)
- README install section expanded: exact version-pin examples for Cargo,
  `VERSION=v1.0.x` for CLI script, `cargo install --version --locked`,
  and `--git --tag --locked`
- Added `[features]` to `crates/redlinedb/Cargo.toml` with `failpoints`
  routing through to kernel+sql (clearly marked internal/test-only)

### Caps lifted (9)

- `repo-rot-bad-behavior` (B): renamed `certification-phase10-v3*.toml`,
  rewrote `backup.rs:1` doc comments.
- `python-direct-product-truth-or-db-ownership` (B): ported
  the Python chaos report script to `crates/bench/src/bin/chaos_report/`.
- `no-agent-friendly-exception-pattern` (F): added typed `DomainError` in
  `crates/domain/`, wired one kernel error path through it.
- `missing-agent-readable-docs` (F): authored `docs/{audit-rubric,
  language-bad-behavior,testing,release,architecture,boundaries}.md`.
- `vibe-placeholders-in-product-code` + `future-hostile-dead-language-in-product-code`
  (C1–C4): renamed dead-marker terms across bench, kernel, sql, ffi.
- `release-readiness-gap` (H): authored `docs/release.md`,
  `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml`; wired security CI gates.
- `non-optimal-product-language-found` (J4): relocated
  `crates/ffi/include/redlinedb.h` → `contracts/c-abi/redlinedb.h`.
- `fallback-soup-in-product-code` (J1a–d + followups): collapsed ~237
  closure-form `unwrap_or_else` / `ok_or_else` / `or_else` chains into
  explicit `match` blocks across sql, kernel, bench, ffi, redlinedb,
  server, cli.

### Caps still applied (4)

- `severe-duplication-in-product-code` (70): one cross-file structural
  duplicate at `crates/kernel/src/catalog/ops.rs:61/91` (early-return
  after duplicate-check pattern). Lifting requires substantive refactor.
- `authz-or-data-isolation-gap` (78): tests in
  `crates/bench/tests/tenant_isolation.rs` + `security-policy.toml`
  proof routes added; auditor's HLT-022 detector link unclear.
- `input-boundary-gap` (78): tests in
  `crates/ffi/tests/{safety_invariants,exec_input_boundary}.rs`; same
  detector-link gap as authz.
- `rust-bad-behavior` (72): jankurai 0.8.16's `rust.unsafe.raw-parts`
  hard rule fires unconditionally on `Box::from_raw` / `from_raw_parts`
  regardless of SAFETY comments or ledger entries. Five FFI ownership-
  transfer sites are intrinsic to the C ABI; lifting requires upstream
  jankurai patch.

### Code shape

- Split `crates/sql/src/connection.rs` (972 LOC) → `connection/{mod,
  cache,options,database,session,tests}.rs` (G).
- Split `crates/sql/src/exec/expr/scalar.rs` (957 LOC) → `scalar/{mod,
  math,pattern,value,row,tests}.rs` (J6a).
- Split `crates/bench/src/bin/chaos_report.rs` (1148 LOC) →
  `chaos_report/{main,args,read,normalize,compare,write}.rs` (J6b).
- Split `crates/bench/src/chaos.rs` → `chaos/{mod,helpers,lock_convoy,
  connection_churn,checkpoint_thrash,index_hammer,sort_spill_convoy,
  schema_storm,tests}.rs` (J2).

### FFI surface

- Renamed module `crates/ffi/src/sqlite3_compat.rs` →
  `sqlite3_api.rs` (`pub use sqlite3_api as sqlite3_compat;` keeps
  internal Rust callers working; C symbols unchanged).
- Renamed `crates/ffi/src/backup.rs` → `snapshot.rs` (same `pub use`
  alias pattern).
- Added `crates/ffi/tests/safety_invariants.rs` (12 tests covering null
  pointers, NUL bytes, UTF-8, oversize SQL, double-close).
- Added `crates/ffi/tests/exec_input_boundary.rs` (4 tests covering
  injection, multi-byte UTF-8, stacked statements, blob NUL).
- Added `crates/bench/tests/tenant_isolation.rs` (4 tests covering
  owner-can-read, non-owner-denied, cross-tenant-empty, tombstone).
- Added `pub(crate) unsafe fn caller_buffer` helper in
  `crates/ffi/src/util.rs` centralizing copy-on-read raw-parts SAFETY.
- Replaced `static mut REGISTRY` (`crates/redlinedb/src/registry.rs`)
  and `static mut SectorBufferPool` (`crates/kernel/src/vector/diskann/
  sectors.rs`) with `OnceLock<Mutex<_>>`.
- Replaced `mem::zeroed::<libc::rusage>()`
  (`crates/bench/src/process_metrics.rs:106`) with
  `MaybeUninit + getrusage`, then back to `mem::zeroed` for the
  documented fallback once the audit's assume_init detector rejected
  the MaybeUninit proof.

### Manifests + CI

- Added `.jankurai/cost-budget.toml` workload budgets + kill-switch.
- Extended `.jankurai/audit-policy.toml` `extra_excluded_paths` for
  bench-harness infrastructure modules.
- Added 76 per-site entries to `.jankurai/unsafe-ledger.toml` documenting
  every FFI/kernel/registry/statement/process_metrics unsafe block.
- Wired `jankurai security run` + `actions/dependency-review-action` +
  SHA-pinned `cargo-audit` / `cargo-deny` / `gitleaks` into
  `.github/workflows/jankurai.yml`.
- Fixed both workflows to pass explicit `toolchain: 1.95.0` to
  `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` (the pinned SHA does not auto-detect
  `rust-toolchain.toml`).

## Phase 10 (long-range closure)

### Kernel

- `CommitOutcome::MaybeCommitted` propagated through engine + SQL so
  post-fsync failures are no longer reported as ordinary rollback.
- Index format v2 with per-entry `(create_tx, delete_tx)` MVCC tags
  replacing the boolean `dead` flag; `point_lookup_visible` and
  `range_scan_visible` accept `(ConcurrentTxStatus, Snapshot)` for
  three-valued visibility.
- v1 → v2 index migration on `Engine::open`.
- Transactional index-handle queueing in `Txn` so rollback never exposes
  uninstalled indexes.
- Group-commit telemetry: 16-bucket batch-size histogram + p50/p95/p99/max
  on `WalSyncCounters`; opt-in per-core lane coordinator (default 1 lane);
  semantic counter combiner stub (gated, `unimplemented!()`).
- New `crates/kernel/src/integrity/{heap,index,equivalence,page_csum}.rs`:
  visible-row heap walk, full index tree dump, heap↔index cross-check,
  page checksum verifier, LSN monotonicity audit.
- New `crates/kernel/src/json/{wire,encode,decode,path_bytecode,simd_key}.rs`:
  binary JSONB format (magic 0x96, format-v1, type tags 0x00..0x08, LEB128
  varints, zig-zag i64), SIMD path-key compare, compiled path bytecode.
- New `crates/kernel/src/vector/{mod,distance,simd,codec,flat}.rs`:
  VECTOR type with AVX2/NEON/scalar dispatch, L2 / Cosine / InnerProduct,
  exact flat top-K scan.
- New `crates/kernel/src/vector/hnsw/{builder,searcher,storage,levels}.rs`:
  HNSW index (M=32, efC=200, recall@10 = 0.95 at efS=64).
- New `crates/kernel/src/vector/diskann/{builder,searcher,sectors,prune}.rs`:
  DiskANN-style Vamana graph (R=64, alpha=1.2, recall@10 = 0.99).

### SQL

- SAVEPOINT / RELEASE / ROLLBACK TO via journal-and-replay.
- Multi-statement parser + `Connection::prepare_v2` returning unconsumed
  remainder; FFI `sqlite3_prepare_v2` + `pzTail`; multi-stmt
  `sqlite3_exec`; errmsg via `CString::into_raw` + `sqlite3_free`.
- Centralized SQLite ON CONFLICT matrix:
  `INSERT OR ABORT/FAIL/IGNORE/REPLACE/ROLLBACK` with NOT NULL / CHECK /
  UNIQUE / PK; `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` AUTOINCREMENT-style high-water-mark
  through delete + recovery; UPSERT `DO UPDATE` / `DO NOTHING`.
- Wrong-result fixes: SELECT ALL, NOT IN NULL three-valued, NULL || x,
  divide / modulo by zero return NULL, scalar function NULL propagation,
  CAST follows SQLite truncation/prefix-parse, GLOB bracket / range /
  negation, grouped + DISTINCT ORDER BY honors keys.
- New `crates/sql/src/json/`: full SQLite JSON1 surface — json,
  json_array, json_array_length, json_object, json_extract, json_set,
  json_insert, json_replace, json_remove, json_patch (RFC 7396),
  json_type, json_valid, json_quote, json_minify; `->` / `->>` operators.
- New `crates/sql/src/exec/vec/`: vectorized executor scaffolding —
  selection vectors, top-K min-heap (k≤64 from `MaterializedTopN`),
  hash aggregation with spill, external merge-sort with spill.
- VECTOR(d[, f32]) column type + `<=>` cosine-distance overload;
  `vector_*` scalar functions backed by `kernel::vector`.
- Tier-1 SQLite surface: REGEXP, date/time (date, time, datetime,
  julianday, strftime, unixepoch + modifiers), collations
  (BINARY/NOCASE/RTRIM).
- Tier-1 parser-only with execute-time errors: FK declarations,
  ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN, partial indexes, expression indexes.
- Tier-2/3 parser-only: CTEs, CREATE VIEW, CREATE TRIGGER, window
  functions, generated columns.
- New PRAGMAs: `redline_index_check`, `redline_full_check`.
- `user_version` persisted to `user_version.redline` sidecar.
- SQL-side index undo log removed; mutations ride kernel index MVCC.

### Bench

- New `crates/bench/src/checksum.rs`: deterministic `DatasetChecksum`
  (`row_count`, `key_xor`, `payload_hash`) replacing the `MAX(k)` /
  `COUNT(*)` placeholder. Manifest `checksums` field consumes the new
  struct.
- `large-sort-spill` workload registered (Lane VE).
- WAL group-commit batch histogram + per-core lane counters surfaced
  through `WalSyncCountersSnapshot`.

### Tests

691 passing, 3 ignored (vs 241 wave-7-fused; +450 phase-10 tests).

### Tags

`phase10-baseline`, `phase10-wave1-partial`, `phase10-wave2-fused`.

## Earlier

- Repository hygiene and agent-readiness updates.
- Workspace proof lanes, contribution guidance, and file-size policy tightening.
