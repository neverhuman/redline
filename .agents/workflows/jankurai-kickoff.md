Read `AGENTS.md` first. Use `.jankurai/JANKURAI_STANDARD.md` as the canonical jankurai standard.
When a user provides a paper, release, implementation, or handoff plan in the conversation, treat that plan as the controlling plan.
Use `jankurai kickoff . --intent "<change request>" --out .jankurai/kickoff.json --md .jankurai/kickoff.md` to turn user intent into a no-write handoff. If changed paths are missing, keep the result planning-safe and ask bounded questions before any mutable command runs.
Expected receipts: `.jankurai/kickoff.json`, `.jankurai/kickoff.md`.
Next command: `jankurai context-pack`.
Stop: the task crosses owners, touches generated zones without source regeneration, or needs a broader proof lane than the receipt can justify.
If jankurai is installed, run `jankurai update --client-start --quiet` before work; do not apply updates unless the user asks.
