# RedlineDB Agent Router

This is the primary GitHub checkout for all Redline development. Component paths
and original identities are recorded in `subrepos.toml`. Use root GitHub workflows
and `scripts/ci-family.sh`; old per-component forge/publication instructions are
historical. Preserve the independent nested Cargo workspaces. Consumer deployment
locks and databases are outside this source/release migration.


## Workspace Boundary

- Mutate source only in the claimed canonical checkout.
- Never switch to sibling clones, archives, backups, resolved symlink targets, or duplicate roots.
- Exact-SHA isolation may use an automatically removed standalone `git clone --no-local` sandbox;
  it must never register a worktree or become a second persistent source of truth.
- Before edits, report `pwd`, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, and `git status --short --branch`.
- Use GitHub pull requests in `neverhuman/RedlineDB`; root workflows are authoritative.

## Zero Git Worktrees — MANDATORY

- Never create or register a Git worktree anywhere, including under `/tmp`.
- Work only in the claimed canonical checkout and preserve source history with Git refs and verified
  bundles, not copied directories.
- Existing auxiliary worktrees are cleanup inputs only. Do not prune or force-remove them without a
  separately claimed, verified cleanup.
- Use only an automatically removed standalone `git clone --no-local` sandbox for exact-SHA
  isolation; it must never be registered with `git worktree`.

Mission: keep invariants local, edit the smallest lawful surface, and preserve raw evidence.

Access contract: use `gh pr ... --repo neverhuman/RedlineDB` and GitHub authentication.

Start here:
- `.jankurai/owner-map.json`
- `.jankurai/test-map.json`
- `.jankurai/proof-lanes.toml`
- `agent/generated-zones.toml`
- `.jankurai/unsafe-ledger.toml`
- `docs/audit-rubric.md` · `docs/language-bad-behavior.md` · `docs/testing.md`
- `docs/architecture.md` · `docs/boundaries.md`

Rules:
- Prefer package-scoped edits over workspace-wide edits.
- Never hand-edit paths listed in `agent/generated-zones.toml`.
- Keep active source files under 2,000 LOC; split or archive anything larger.
- Do not compress away exit codes, failing test names, panic text, spans, advisory IDs, seeds, raw-log paths, or raw-log hashes.
- Treat `just fast` as the default proof lane, then widen only when the edit crosses contract, security, or concurrency boundaries.
