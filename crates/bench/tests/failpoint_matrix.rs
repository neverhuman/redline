//! Lane E bench-side smoke tests for the failpoint matrix.

//! These guard the two seams that are easy to break in isolation:
//! the TOML schema (any field rename in `FailpointMatrixCase` breaks
//! parsing silently if no test loads the file) and the end-to-end
//! parent/child handshake (a regression in `failpoint::cfg` wiring or
//! the ack-log protocol means Lane E silently passes everything).
//!
//! Lane F6 reviewer-finding tests cover the two correctness fixes:
//! the ack-log fsync contract (`ack_log_is_fsynced`) and the
//! verbatim passthrough of failpoint actions
//! (`failpoint_action_return_is_honored`).
