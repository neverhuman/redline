/// document *why* the gate chose one path over the other; the
/// `Dispatch` variant is the only one that would actually fan work
/// out across the rayon pool. Today no production covering pipeline
/// reaches `Dispatch` because the path walks index leaves rather
/// than heap pages — see the module note at the gate site for
/// the rationale (kept here so tests can assert the predicate's
/// per-condition behaviour without rebuilding the gate).
