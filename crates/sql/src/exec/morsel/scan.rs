//! Morsel scan source. Wraps any row-at-a-time iterator (heap scan,
//! `RawIndexCursor` walk, synthetic generator) and rebatches its output
//! into columnar `Morsel<'arena>`s of up to `batch_target_rows` rows.
//!
//! The trait is intentionally narrow: a single `next_row` -> `Option<&[ValueRef]>`
//! that the scan loop drains into a `MorselBuilder`. Heap-scan and
//! `RawIndexCursor` adapters land alongside the executor wiring in M7;
//! this module exposes the shape so kernels (M3+) and tests (this round)
//! can be written against it.
