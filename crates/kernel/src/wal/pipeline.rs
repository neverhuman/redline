//! Phase 6 R4-B (Candidate 4): dedicated append-only WAL writer thread.
//!
//! # Design intent
//!
//! The existing kernel WAL writer (in [`crate::wal::manager`] and
//! [`crate::wal::lanes`]) batches commits inside a single lane via a
//! mutex-guarded pending queue and one `write_all_at` + `sync_data`
//! per drain. That path is proven and correct, and stays in place.
//!
//! This module is the **next layer**: an opt-in append-only writer
//! thread that
//!
//! 1. owns the WAL file exclusively (no locks on the hot path),
//! 2. receives `WalRecord`s over a bounded
//!    [`crossbeam_channel`] from N producer threads,
//! 3. coalesces multiple producer submissions into a single batch
//!    sized by record count (default 64) **and** by byte budget
//!    (default 1 MiB),
//! 4. sorts the batch by `(page_id_hint, lsn)` so the resulting
//!    dirty-page queue lands on disk in page-order (matching the
//!    "checkpoint as background stage" expectation from the
//!    theoretical-limit spec),
//! 5. computes the per-record CRC32 in one vectorized pass before
//!    any I/O — `crc32fast` auto-selects PCLMUL on x86_64, so the
//!    pass amortizes the channel-drain cost across the batch,
//! 6. issues a single `writev`/`write_vectored` syscall per batch,
//!    falling back to a `write_at` loop only when the vector exceeds
//!    `IOV_MAX` slices,
//! 7. optionally `fdatasync`s after each batch — flipped off this
//!    becomes "let the page cache decide" for write-heavy benchmark
//!    runs where the operator owns durability externally.
//!
//! # Boundary
//!
//! This module is **scaffolding**. It is gated behind the
//! `wal_pipeline` Cargo feature and is not wired into the engine's
//! production WAL path; the engine's `Database` keeps using
//! [`crate::wal::WalCoordinator`] / [`crate::wal::WalLaneCoordinator`]
//! exactly as before. Phase 7 will own the swap-in.
//!
//! When the `wal_pipeline` feature is OFF this file is not compiled
//! at all — the build is byte-identical to the pre-R4-B binary, which
//! the `feature_off_is_byte_identical_to_lanes` integration test
//! pins against the lane coordinator's segment layout.
