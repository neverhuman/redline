//! Deterministic failpoint registry for the RedlineDB kernel.
//!
//! When the `failpoints` feature is enabled, this module forwards to the
//! [`fail`](https://docs.rs/fail) crate so that tests and benchmarks can
//! configure injection of `panic`, `return(value)`, `off`, `sleep(N)`,
//! `pause`, `print`, and `yield` actions at named points in kernel code.
//!
//! When the feature is disabled, every entry point is an inline no-op so the
//! release build pays zero runtime cost. Lane D owns this scaffolding only;
//! Lane E wires the actual `fail_point!` invocations into hot paths.
