//! RedlineDB transactional storage kernel primitives.
//!
//! This crate starts with the correctness-critical foundation: typed storage IDs,
//! explicit on-disk page/WAL encodings, checksums, and MVCC visibility rules.

/// A26: process-wide cached `std::thread::available_parallelism()`.
///
/// `available_parallelism()` on Linux walks the cgroup hierarchy looking for
/// CPU limits — each call does 5+ statx/openat syscalls reading
/// `/proc/self/cgroup` + walking up `/sys/fs/cgroup/.../cpu.max` ancestors.
/// `EngineConfig::default()` and `BufferPool::new()` BOTH call it, so every
/// `:memory:` open paid the probe twice. The parity corpus opens 1127 fresh
/// processes — that's > 10000 wasted syscalls and a real chunk of the
/// startup tax the profiling agent identified.
///
/// Cached in a process-wide `OnceLock`. CPU limits don't change during a
/// process's lifetime so caching is safe; first call still does the probe,
/// subsequent calls are an atomic load.
